   Read a total of 222 trees in 2 files (sampling 168 of them)
      (Each file contained 111 trees of which 84 were sampled)
                                                                                   
   General explanation:                                                          
                                                                                   
   In an unrooted tree, a taxon bipartition (split) is specified by removing a   
   branch, thereby dividing the species into those to the left and those to the  
   right of the branch. Here, taxa to one side of the removed branch are denoted 
   '.' and those to the other side are denoted '*'. Specifically, the '.' symbol 
   is used for the taxa on the same side as the outgroup.                        
                                                                                   
   In a rooted or clock tree, the tree is rooted using the model and not by      
   reference to an outgroup. Each bipartition therefore corresponds to a clade,  
   that is, a group that includes all the descendants of a particular branch in  
   the tree.  Taxa that are included in each clade are denoted using '*', and    
   taxa that are not included are denoted using the '.' symbol.                  
                                                                                   
   The output first includes a key to all the bipartitions with frequency larger 
   or equual to (Minpartfreq) in at least one run. Minpartfreq is a parameter to 
   sumt command and currently it is set to 0.10.  This is followed by a table  
   with statistics for the informative bipartitions (those including at least    
   two taxa), sorted from highest to lowest probability. For each bipartition,   
   the table gives the number of times the partition or split was observed in all
   runs (#obs) and the posterior probability of the bipartition (Probab.), which 
   is the same as the split frequency. If several runs are summarized, this is   
   followed by the minimum split frequency (Min(s)), the maximum frequency       
   (Max(s)), and the standard deviation of frequencies (Stddev(s)) across runs.  
   The latter value should approach 0 for all bipartitions as MCMC runs converge.
                                                                                   
   This is followed by a table summarizing branch lengths, node heights (if a    
   clock model was used) and relaxed clock parameters (if a relaxed clock model  
   was used). The mean, variance, and 95 % credible interval are given for each 
   of these parameters. If several runs are summarized, the potential scale      
   reduction factor (PSRF) is also given; it should approach 1 as runs converge. 
   Node heights will take calibration points into account, if such points were   
   used in the analysis.                                                         
                                                                                 
   Note that Stddev may be unreliable if the partition is not present in all     
   runs (the last column indicates the number of runs that sampled the partition 
   if more than one run is summarized). The PSRF is not calculated at all if     
   the partition is not present in all runs.The PSRF is also sensitive to small  
   sample sizes and it should only be considered a rough guide to convergence    
   since some of the assumptions allowing one to interpret it as a true potential
   scale reduction factor are violated in MrBayes.

   Below are rough plots of the generation (x-axis) versus the log   
   probability of observing the data (y-axis). You can use these     
   graphs to determine what the burn in for your analysis should be. 
   When the log probability starts to plateau you may be at station- 
   arity. Sample trees and parameters after the log probability      
   plateaus. Of course, this is not a guarantee that you are at sta- 
   tionarity. Also examine the convergence diagnostics provided by   
   the 'sump' and 'sumt' commands for all the parameters in your     
   model. Remember that the burn in is the number of samples to dis- 
   card. There are a total of ngen / samplefreq samples taken during 
   a MCMC analysis.

   * Convergence diagnostic (ESS = Estimated Sample Size); min and avg values
     correspond to minimal and average ESS among runs. 
     ESS value below 100 may indicate that the parameter is undersampled. 
   + Convergence diagnostic (PSRF = Potential Scale Reduction Factor; Gelman
     and Rubin, 1992) should approach 1.0 as runs converge.
